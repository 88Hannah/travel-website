                    <p>We were lucky enough to spend five weeks in New Zealand and we totally fell in love. We encountered beaches with palm trees and snow capped mountains, it really does have it all. </p>
                    <p>We were blessed with fantastic weather the whole time that we were there and got to experience so many different things. </p>
                    <p>We enjoyed travelling around in our rental cars and shopping in the local supermarkets. By the end of the five weeks we almost felt like we lived there and I really didnâ€™t want to leave. </p>

								<p>After a night flight from Perth we were very tired when we arrived but unfortunately we had another four hours before we could check into the hostel so we ended up going to the cinema.</p>
								<p class="mb-0">The following day we took a walk up Mount Eden where there were nice views of the city followed by some drinks down by the harbour. </p>

								<p>We had to take a car ferry to get to our accommodation here. It was a lovely little chalet with canoes and access to a little private pebble beach. </p>
								<p class="mb-0">It was here that we did our first of many hikes, just a short one to get us started but it still had amazing views. </p>

                                    The toilet was a short walk down the forest path and there was no electricity let alone wifi! 
                                    We had a good game of scrabble and walked deep into the forest in the evening to see the glow worms. </p>

								<h5 class="card-title">Coromandel</h5>
								<p>Here we visited Cathedral Cove which is accessible only by foot or sea. 
                                    Although it was a lovely place, the other tourists made it impossible to get the same peaceful pictures that you see on the internet. </p>
								<p class="mb-0">It was here that we also went to one of the most surreal beaches of the trip - Hot Water Beach. 
                                    There were certain areas where you could dig a hole and when you reached water it was hot. Sometimes it was even so hot that it burnt!</p>

								<p>The highest commercially rafted waterfall is just outside Rotorua and we had to try it out. It was great fun only one of us fell out. </p>
								<p>The town itself has a bit of a funny smell as there is a lot of geothermal activity so we also visited some nearby naturally warm streams and waterfalls.</p>
								<p class="mb-0">There are also lots of redwood trees where they have created a tree walk high up in the trees. </p>

								<p class="mb-0">The Tongariro Alpine Crossing was our first big hike. We had to get up early to get the shuttle bus to the start. 
                                    There were sections with lots of steps and it was very windy at the top. 
                                    There are beautiful blue lakes along the track which are like nothing that you have ever seen before. </p>

                                    We couldnâ€™t believe how windy it was and we had to abandon our walk around the city. Instead we just went for a drink and a nice Italian meal!</p>

                                    We cycled around a few of the vineyards to do some wine tasting but unfortunately a few too many beers in the pub the night before meant that we didnâ€™t head out until gone midday so our tasting time was limited. </p>

                                    We spent an afternoon canoeing around the coast and the next day we took a water taxi up the coast and walked back along the coast track with stops at beaches and streams along the way. </p>

							<div class="card-body">
								<h5 class="card-title">Kaikoura</h5>
								<p>Back onto the east coast we stopped off at Kaikoura as itâ€™s known as a great place to go whale watching. We hadnâ€™t left ourselves any leeway but thankfully we were lucky with the weather and our trip went ahead. 
                                    Iâ€™d visited the local pharmacy the day before and got some amazing sea sickness tablets; Iâ€™ve never felt so good on a boat!</p>
								<p class="mb-0">The crew were great and they knew exactly where the whales would be. We managed to see three while we were out there. </p>

								<h5 class="card-title">Arthurâ€™s Pass</h5>
								<p class="mb-0">This was definitely one of our hardest hikes. It wasnâ€™t very long but we gained so much height and were scrambling in certain parts! 
                                    The views from the top were worth it though. It was so peaceful up there.</p>

								<p class="mb-0">These glaciers are over on the west side of the South Island near Mount Cook which is New Zealandâ€™s tallest mountain. 
                                    We took a walk to Robertâ€™s Point which gave us good views of Franz Josef Glacier. 
                                    This is also where we did our skydive. From the air we could see both glaciers, the coast and Mount Cook, it really was amazing!</p>

								<h5 class="card-title">Wanaka</h5>
								<p class="mb-0">There is a lovely lake in Wanaka which has a willow tree growing out of it. I think everyone that visits takes the same photo. 
                                    It is also a good location for a couple more hikes. We chose to do the less popular route of Isthmus Peak Track which gave us lovely views of both Lake Wanaka and Lake Hawea. </p>

								<h5 class="card-title">Queenstown</h5>
								<p></p>
								<p class="mb-0">We took some time to relax in Queenstown and spent four nights here, our longest stay of the trip so far. 
                                    It is known for its adrenaline sports so we had to have a go on the jet boat and the luge karting. 
                                    We also found another long hike which had views back down into the town. 
                                    You canâ€™t visit Queenstown without a trip to Fergburger and we managed to eat there three times in just four days. </p>

                                    Unfortunately there were bad floods that damaged the only road leading there so we booked ourselves an expensive flight instead and weâ€™re so glad that we did! 
                                    The views from the tiny plane were amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. </p>

                                    From here we took trips to Mount Cook national park where we did both the Hooker Valley track and the Mueller Hut route. 
                                    We also took a night trip to Tekapo for a dark skies tour. I couldnâ€™t believe how much we could see and I even learnt how to find the Southern Cross. </p>

                                    The city is still recovering from the earthquake in 2011 but the repair work is well on its way and there are some really nice places opening up along the river.</p>
